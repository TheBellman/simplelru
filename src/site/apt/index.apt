SimpleLRU

   SimpleLRU provides a simple cache with a capped size, so that if you try to add more to the cache than it will
   hold, the oldest item in the cache is ejected. There is also an extended variant cache where items will expire
   from the cache after a certain time. These caches live in memory, and in process, so they are mainly intended for
   use for such things as keeping a local copy of fetched resources that you may need again in the near future.
